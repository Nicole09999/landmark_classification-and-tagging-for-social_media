## Project Overview

This project involves the use of transfer learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to create and deploy AI models. A Voila-based web app is also provided to interact with these models.

## Directory Structure

- `checkpoints/`: Directory containing model checkpoint files.
- `src/`: Source code directory.
  - `data.py`: Data loading and preprocessing functions.
  - `transfer.py`: Transfer learning functions.
  - `cnn.py`: CNN model architecture.
  - `optimization.py`: Optimization and loss functions.
  - `train.py`: Training functions.
- `app.ipynb`: Voila app notebook.
- `transfer_learning.ipynb`: Notebook for transfer learning.
- `cnn_model.ipynb`: Notebook for CNN model training.
- `README.md`: This README file.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Transfer Learning

1. Open the `transfer_learning.ipynb` notebook.
2. Follow the steps to load and train the transfer learning model.
3. Save the trained model checkpoint in the `checkpoints` directory.

### CNN Model

1. Open the `cnn_model.ipynb` notebook.
2. Follow the steps to define, train, and evaluate the CNN model.
3. Save the trained model checkpoint in the `checkpoints` directory.

### Voila App

1. Open the `app.ipynb` notebook.
2. Follow the steps to set up the Voila app interface.
3. Run the following command to launch the app:
    ```bash
    voila app.ipynb --show_tracebacks=True
    ```
4. Interact with the app in your web browser.
